'''Build a mortgage calculator to determine monthly payments, with monthly interest

You will need three pieces of information:
1. the loan amount
2. the Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
3. the loan duration

from the above you will need to calculate the following things:

1. Monthly interest rate (APR/12)
2. loan duration in months

You can use the following formula:

m = p*(j/(1-(1+j)**(-n)))

m = month payment
p = loan amount
j = monthly interest rate
n = loan duration in months

-dont use single letters to write the program
-print payment amount as dollars with 2 decimals
-dont forget to run your code with Pylint '''
