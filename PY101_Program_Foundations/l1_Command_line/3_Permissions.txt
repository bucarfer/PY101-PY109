1. Which user and group are assigned to the /etc folder on your computer?
First we cd / -> then we change to directory etc -> finally we run the command "ls -lah"
LS solution: $ ls -l /
The "root" user and the "wheel" group

2. Which user and group are assigned to the $HOME folder?
Similar command as exercise 1: $ ls -la $HOME 
Single dot refers to current directory where the user is "fernando" and the group is "staff"

3. What are the mary's permissions for the napkins file in the following outputs?

$ groups mary
mary travelers vip

-rw-rw----  1 acmeair acmeair 0 Jul 21 17:57 napkins
-rw-rw----  1 acmeair acmeair 0 Jul 21 17:57 paper_towels

the napkins object has the following permissions:
for user is acmeair: read and write

for others: non permissions

Since Mary is not part of the acmeair group, she doesn't have access to or any level of permission.

6. Practice using sudo to log in as root: 

$ cd
$ sudo su
Password:
root@host:/home/ubuntu#
Exit out of the root user session:

root@host:/home/ubuntu# exit
$
Log in as root in root's home directory:

$ sudo su -
Password:
root@host:~# exit
$
Run a command as root:

$ ls /root
ls: cannot open directory /root: Permission denied
$ sudo ls /root
Password:
$
Note: You may not get the same results on your computer when running the above command. Specifically, if you are on a Mac, you probably don't have a /root directory. The above is an example of what you may see in a typical Linux environment.

Steps for Mac users:
1. cd # open terminal and go to home 
2. sudo su # switch to root temporarily 
3. root@your-mac:/Users/your-username# #enter mac account Password
4. exit
5. sudo su - #log in as root with root's environment 
6. exit 
7. Run a single command as root:
ls /var/root        # ❌ Will fail (permission denied)
sudo ls /var/root   # ✅ Will work (after password)
